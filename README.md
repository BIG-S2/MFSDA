# MFSDA
Multivariate Functional Shape Data Analysis (MFSDA) is a Matlab based toolbox for statistical shape analysis. A multivariate varying coefficient model is used to build the association between the multivariate shape measurements and demographic information and other clinical variables. Statistical inference, i.e., hypothesis testing, are also included in this toolbox, which can be used in inestigating whether some covariates of interest are significantly associated with the shape information. The hypothesis testing results are further used in clustering based analysis, i.e., significant suregion detection.
